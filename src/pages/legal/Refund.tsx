            <h2>30-Day "Circle of Life" Guarantee</h2>
            <p>
                We want you to love your ReLeaf case. If you're not completely satisfied, you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.
            </p>

            <h2>Eligibility</h2>
            <p>
                To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging.
            </p>

            <h2>Composting vs. Returning</h2>
            <p>
                Since our cases are 100% compostable, if your case is damaged or at the end of its life, we encourage you to compost it rather than shipping it back (to reduce carbon footprint). However, for defects or manufacturing issues, we will always provide a full refund or replacement.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Start a Return</h2>
            <p>
